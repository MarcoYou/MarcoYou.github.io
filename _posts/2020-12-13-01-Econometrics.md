This course is an introduction to master level Econometrics. It covers linear regression with single and multiple regressors, non-linear effects and models for panel data. It also introduces non parametric techniques applied to density estimation and regression. Applications and examples are developed using R and Python.

## 1. Population and Sample

In any statistical studies, there are population and sample(s). A population is a set that includes individuals that we want to study. A sample is a part of population that includes some individuals that we want to study (e.g every korean male population and some korean male sample).

Almost always, we cannot know all the statistical properties of a population because often it is impossible (how will you assess to every korean male?) or even if it were possible, it is too costly in terms of money and time to do so.
