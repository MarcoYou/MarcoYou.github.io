# Non-Linear Regression Functions

## 1. Introduction

Two types of non-linearity in regression functions:

- Non-linear functions of a single independent varialbe (most prevailing type)
  - Polynomials
  - Logarithms
  - Interactions
  - (these 3 types are all eligible for OLS estimation)
- Regression functions that are non-linear in the parameters (only a sketch here)

We are going to study 2 groups of methods useful when

- the relation between \\(X_1\\) and \\(Y\\) depends on the value of \\(X_1\\) itself;
- the relation between \\(X_1\\) and \\(Y\\) depends on the value of \\(X_2\\)

### 1.1 General Approach

In general, the population regression function reads

$$ Y_i = f(X_{1i}, \cdots, X_{ni}) + u_i~~~~~i=1,\cdots,n $$

where f can be a linear or non-linear function.

In the population, the effect on Y of a change in \\(X_1\\), \\(\Delta X_1\\) is:

- \\(\beta_1 \Delta X_1 ~\\) if f is linear;
- \\( f(X_{1i}+\Delta X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \cdots, X_{ni} ) - f(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \cdots, X_{ni})~  \\) **if f is non linear**

Since this is a population regression function, of course, both \\(\beta_1\\) and \\(f\\) are unknown and need to be estimated by \\(\hat{\beta}_1\\) and \\(\hat{f}\\).

### 1.2 Modeling Non-Linearities

1. Identify a possible non-linear relation based on the underlying economic theory;
2. Specify a non-linear function and estimate its parameters by OLS method;
3. Determine if the non-linear model improves upon a linear model;
4. Plot the estimated non-linear regression function (if possible);
5. Estimate the effect on Y of a change in X.

### 1.3 Notation

How to estimate the effect on Y of a change in X? by measuring the **elasticity**.

The **elasticity** of Y with respect to X is

$$ E \equiv \frac{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}{\frac{\Delta X}{X}} = \frac{X}{Y}\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} $$

E gives us the percentage points change of Y associated with a 1% increase in X.

**Note Bene**

Going from 10% to 11% is either a 1 percentage point increase or 10% increase. It is not a 1% increase.

## 2. Polynomial Non-Linear Regression Function

Before getting into it, polynomial specification of non-linear regression function is not frequently used in econometrics modeling.

This is the first way to specify a non-linear regression for \\(X_1\\) using a polynomial in \\(X_1\\):

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{11}X_1 + \beta_{12}X^2_1 + \cdots + \beta_{1r}X^r_1 + u $$

- Obviously this model is easily estimatable with OLS (in R, lm(y ~ X + X^2 + ...))
- With r = 2 and r = 3 we obtain the quadratic and cubic regression models (r = 3 happens almost never)
- Using the F-test and the t-test, you can test hypothesis on the linear vs polynomial nature of the population regression function: \\( H_0:\beta_{12}=0~~vs~~H_1:\beta_{12}â‰ 0\\)
- Interpreting coefficients in a polynomial regression function is not trivial, the best is to plot the function and compute the estimated effect on Y of a change in \\(X_1\\) for different values of \\(X_1\\).

Let's take a simple example.

### 2.1 Quadratic Regression Model

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X^2_{1i} + u_i $$

- \\(\beta_1\\) cannot be anymore the effect on Y of a change of \\(X_1\\) holding \\(X^2_1\\) constant.
- the effect on Y of a change in \\(X_1\\) is indeed given by

$$ \frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \beta_1 + 2\beta_2 X_1 $$

this depends on the value of \\(X_1\\).

**example)**

We can think of this kind of regression:

$$ Price_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Nrooms_i + \beta_2 Nrooms^2_i + u_i $$

## 3. Logarithmic Non-Linear Regression

This is the second way to specify a non-linear regression for \\(X_1\\) using logarithms in \\(X_1\\). This is by far the most used and the most useful non-linear regression function.

### 3.1 Notation

Given a model like

$$ \ln(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(X) $$

we have to consider the following things

- \\(\ln(Y + \Delta Y) - \ln(Y)\\) is the logarithmic difference
- \\( \frac{\Delta \ln(Y)}{\Delta \ln(X_1)}\\) is the log derivative of Y as a function of \\(X_1\\)
- These are the **two important relations**:
  - if \\(\Delta Y / Y \approx 0\\) then \\( \log(Y + \Delta Y) - \log(Y) \approx \Delta Y / Y \\)
  - **elasticity of Y wrt** \\(X_1\\): \\( \frac{\Delta \log(Y)}{\Delta \log(X_1)} = \frac{\Delta Y / Y}{\Delta X_1 / X_1} = \frac{\Delta Y X_1}{\Delta X_1 Y} \\)

In the case of logarithmic regression, interpretation for elasticity changes depending on the type of logarithmic regression. **There are three types of logarithmic regression function:**

- \\(Y\\) and \\(\log(X)\\): linear-log model
- \\(\log(Y)\\) and \\(X\\): log-linear model
- \\(\log(Y)\\) and \\(\log(X)\\): log-log model

### 3.2 Linear-Log Model

First type of logarithmic regression model is linear-log model that reads

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(X_i) + u_i $$

The effect on Y of a change in X is captured by:

$$\begin{align} \Delta Y(X) &= \frac{\Delta Y(X)}{\Delta \log(X)} \times \frac{\Delta \log(X)}{\Delta X} \Delta X \\ &= \beta_1 \frac{\Delta X}{X} \end{align}$$

where

- \\(\frac{\Delta Y(X)}{\Delta \log(X)}\\) captures the change in Y depending on the change in \\(\log(X)\\) (bc Y depends on \\(\log(X)\\));
- \\(\frac{\Delta \log(X)}{\Delta X}\\) captures the change in \\(\log(X)\\) depending on the change in X (bc \\(\log(X)\\) depends on X);
- Lastly \\(\Delta X\\) is multiplied becaused everything, in the end, depends on X.

Hence we can use the following measure

$$ \Delta Y(X) = \beta_1 \frac{\Delta X}{X} = \frac{\beta_1}{100}\frac{\Delta X}{X}100 $$

which implies that **a change of X by 1% is associated with an absolute change in Y of \\(\frac{\beta_1}{100}=0.01\beta_1\\).**

### 3.3 Log-Linear Model

Second type of logarithmic regression model is log-linear model that reads

$$ \log(Y_i) - \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + u_i $$

The effect on Y of a change in X is captured by:

$$\begin{align}
\Delta Y(X) &= \frac{\Delta Y(X)}{\Delta \log(X)} \times \frac{\Delta \log(X)}{\Delta X} \Delta X \\
&= \left( \frac{\Delta \log(X) }{\Delta Y(X)} \right)^{-1} \times \frac{\Delta \log(X)}{\Delta X} \Delta X \\
&= \left( \frac{1}{Y} \right)^{-1} \times \frac{\Delta \log(X)}{\Delta X} \Delta X \\
&= \beta_1 Y \Delta X
\end{align}$$

Hence we can use the following measure

$$ \frac{\Delta Y(X)}{Y}100 = 100 \beta_1 \Delta X $$

which implies that **a marginal change of X is associated with a change in Y of \\([100 \beta_1]\% \\)**.

### 3.4 Log-Log Model

Third type of logarithmic regression model is log-log model that reads

$$ \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(X_i) + u_i $$

The effect on Y of a change in X is captured by:

$$ \begin{align} \Delta Y(X) &= Y \frac{\Delta \log(Y)}{\Delta \log(X)} \frac{\Delta \log(X)}{\Delta X} \Delta X \\ &= \beta_1 \frac{Y}{X} \Delta X \end{align} $$

Hence we can use the following measure

$$ \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}100 = \beta_1 \frac{\Delta X}{X} 100 $$

which implies that **a change of 1% of X is associated with a change in Y of \\(\beta_1\\)%**. \\(\beta_1\\) is an elasticity.

### 3.5 Elasticity Summary

In general, when reporting results, elasticities should be preferred since they are easier to interpret and to be compared.

| Case      | Regression Models | Elasticity of \\(E[Y/X]\\) wrt X  |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Linear    | \\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X \\)       |                             |
| Linear-Log| \\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(X) \\)                  |                             |
| Log-Linear| \\(\log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X \\)                  |                             |
| Log-Log   | \\(\log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(X) \\)                  |                             |
