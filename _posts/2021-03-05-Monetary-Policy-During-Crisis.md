## Role of FED during Sanitary Crisis

The ultimate goal of any central bank is to make the economy to prosper in long run. One of the key requirements, or possibly the most important requirement, is the **full employment**.

Even though it is obvious to say that full employment is important and is a good thing for the economy, it is not obvious why it is important and how it is important. Let's first discuss that.

When the number of jobs decreases, the overall consumption decreases. A decrease in consumption implies a decrease in demand. A decrease in demand then causes a decrease in supply. If the supply decreases, companies stop or reduce their investment. And once they stop investing, then no jobs are created. If there are no jobs created, then again, it leads to another decrease in demand, so on and so forth. This is the phenomenon called **Secular Stagflation** that Lawrence Summers, 27th U.S Secretary of the Treasury, was worried about.

To stop this somewhat vicious cycle, a government can hire more people by itself. Or, it can force companies to hire more people. But they both sound ridiculous, right? So the best strategy would be to **encourage companies to invest**. To do so, in the case of the U.S, the FED can foster an environment that gives companies an incentive to invest more. And the incentive would be a **cheaper price of debt**. When debt is cheap enough relative to inflation rate, then at some point, it is same as just giving them (almost or literally) free money when companies decide to borrow money from banks.

**So how do you make debt cheaper?**

## Monetary Policy of FED

1일짜리 vs 10년짜리 (모기지는 10년짜리랑 연동)

I personally identify 3 tools that allow FED to make debt cheaper. But before getting into it, I have to explain what kind of debt I am talking about and why particularly that specific kind of debt is important.

**First, what kind of debt we are talking about?**

Here, we are talking about notes. It is not a commercial loan or any sorts like that. We are precisely talking about **the U.S. 10-year treasury note** (often called **10Y T-note** or by its ticker **^TNX**), which is a type of debt that can be traded and whose issuer is the federal government of the U.S. having a maturity equal to 10 years.

- **T-Bills**: short maturity terms, from 4 weeks to a year;
- **T-Notes**: middle maturity terms, from 2 to 10 years;
- **U.S. Bonds**: long maturity terms, from 20 to 30 years.

**Second, why is 10Y T-Note important?**

The type of Asset-Backed Security (ABS) that holds the **largest amount of capital** is the **Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)** in the U.S.. It is incomparable with all the other types of ABSs as shows the chart below.

Because of its size and also the fact that it is "Mortgage-Backed", it made it so important in the U.S. Economy. And why am I talking about MBS? it is because, as the chart below shows, **_30-Year Fixed Average Mortgage Rate_ is tightly coupled with the _10Y T-Note Rate_**.

Now we understand what kind of debt that FED targets and why it is important. We can proceed to discuss the 3 tools that I mentionned at the beginning of this section.

Let me list them first.

1. Controling the Benchmark Interest Rates
2. Quantitative Easing
  - QE with Federal Bonds
  - QE with Corporate Bonds
3. Alternative Long-Term Yield Direct Intervention:
  - Yield Curve Control (YCC)
  - Operation Twist

### 1. Controling the Benchmark Interest Rates

In the U.S, the benchmark interest rates are called **Federal Funds Rate**. Federal funds rate (FFR) is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other **overnight**. So this is an extremely short-term interest rate. Since all the interest rates of different maturities are increasingly aligned according to the maturity term risk, by lowering or lifting the FFR, the FED can, in theory, control all the other interest rates of longer maturity terms.

Let's take a look at the image below.

<p align="center"> <img src="/image/memo/FFR.jpeg" alt="FFR" width="500" height="360"> </p>

(forget about my bad drawing skill)

If FED Chairman Powell pulls down FFR, then all the other interest rates on the rope, including the 10Y T-Note rate, will come down altogether. This is how FED controls the money supply in the market.

But when the economic burden is too heavy, it is hardly possible to control the long term rates as they tend to resist more when the economy is going through a recession and also naturally the impact of change in FFR is less direct on them.

This is why Quantiative Easing is necessary. It is as if Powell goes up on a ladder and pulls down the rope at 10Y T-Note level. This is why we often say this method is not conventional.

### 2. Quantitative Easing
#### QE with Federal Bonds

Let's recall that FED wants to encourge companies to invest more therefore to create more jobs. And they encourage companies by (let's be simple) providing them low-price liquidity.

Let's see how QE works:

In the step number 2, we see that FED purchases government denominated debt. By the law of supply and demand, **extra demand for these government bonds lowers the interest rate of bonds** in the first round of this operation (FED must have lowered the FFR before QE so this is also another explanatory factor of decreasing bond interest rate).

In addition, **QE will reduce the supply of long-term bonds in the secondary market since a huge part of these bonds will be bought by the FED**. This, in second round, **causes bond prices to increase**. (But you might ask why should anypne buy these expensive bonds. It is because huge financial instituations like pension funds or life insurance companies must comply to liquidity and solvency regulations)

In combination, **bond yields will go down, which makes other risky assets more attractive, such as stocks**.

### 3. Alternative Long-Term Yield Direct Intervention
#### Yield Curve Control (YCC)
#### Operation Twist
