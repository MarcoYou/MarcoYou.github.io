## Role of FED during Sanitary Crisis

The ultimate goal of any central bank is to make the economy to prosper in long run. One of the key requirements, or possibly the most important requirement, is the **full employment**.

Even though it is obvious to say that full employment is important and is a good thing for the economy, it is not obvious why it is important and how it is important. Let's first discuss that.

When the number of jobs decreases, the overall consumption decreases. A decrease in consumption implies a decrease in demand. A decrease in demand then causes a decrease in supply. If the supply decreases, companies stop or reduce their investment. And once they stop investing, then no jobs are created. If there are no jobs created, then again, it leads to another decrease in demand, so on and so forth. This is the phenomenon called **Secular Stagflation** that Lawrence Summers, 27th U.S Secretary of the Treasury, was worried about.

To stop this somewhat vicious cycle, a government can hire more people by itself. Or, it can force companies to hire more people. But they both sound ridiculous and too easy, right? So the best strategy would be to **encourage companies to invest**. To do so, in the case of the U.S, the FED can foster an environment that gives companies incentive to invest more. And the incentive would be a **cheaper price of debt**.

**So how do you make debt cheaper?**

## Monetary Policy of FED

1일짜리 vs 10년짜리 (모기지는 10년짜리랑 연동)

I personally identify 4 tools that allow FED to make debt cheaper. But before getting into it, I have to explain what kind of debt I am talking about and why particularly that specific kind of debt is important.

**First, what kind of debt we are talking about?**

Here, we are talking about notes. It is not a commercial loan or any sorts like that. We are precisely talking about **the U.S. 10-year treasury note** (often called **10Y T-note** or by its ticker **^TNX**), which is a type of debt that can be traded and whose issuer is the federal government of the U.S. having a maturity equal to 10 year.

- **T-Bills**: short maturity terms, from 4 weeks to a year;
- **T-Notes**: middle maturity terms, from 2 to 10 years;
- **U.S. Bonds**: long maturity terms, from 20 to 30 years.

**Second, why is 10Y T-Note important?**

The type of Asset-Backed Security (ABS) that holds the **largest amount of capital** is the **Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)** in the U.S.. It is incomparable with all the other types of ABSs as shows the chart below.

Because of its size and also the fact that it is "Mortgage-Backed", it made it so important in the U.S. Economy. And why am I talking about MBS? it is because, as the chart below shows, **_30-Year Fixed Average Mortgage Rate_ is tightly coupled with the _10Y T-Note Rate_**.

Now we understand what kind of debt that FED targets and why it is important. We can proceed to discuss the 4 tools that I mentionned at the beginning of this section.

### 1. Controling the Benchmark Interest Rates

In the U.S, the benchmark interest rates are called **Federal Funds Rate**. Federal funds rate (FFR) is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other **overnight**. So this is an extremely short-term interest rate. Since all the interest rates of different maturities are increasingly aligned according to the maturity term risk, by lowering or lifting the FFR, the FED can, in theory, control all the other interest rates of longer maturity terms.

Let's take a look at the image below.
