## Role of FED during Sanitary Crisis

The ultimate goal of any central bank is to make the economy to prosper in long run. One of the key requirements, or possibly the most important requirement, is the **full employment**.

Even though it is obvious to say that full employment is important and is a good thing for the economy, it is not obvious why it is important and how it is important. Let's first discuss that.

When the number of jobs decreases, the overall consumption decreases. A decrease in consumption implies a decrease in demand. A decrease in demand then causes a decrease in supply. If the supply decreases, companies stop or reduce their investment. And once they stop investing, then no jobs are created. If there are no jobs created, then again, it leads to another decrease in demand, so on and so forth. This is the phenomenon called **Secular Stagflation** that Lawrence Summers, 27th U.S Secretary of the Treasury, was worried about.

To stop this somewhat vicious cycle, a government can hire more people by itself. Or, it can force companies to hire more people. But they both sound ridiculous and too easy, right? So the best strategy would be to **encourage companies to invest**. To do so, in the case of the U.S, the FED can foster an environment that gives companies incentive to invest more. And the incentive would be a **cheaper price of debt**.

So how do you make debt cheaper?

## Monetary Policy of FED

1일짜리 vs 10년짜리 (모기지는 10년짜리랑 연동)

I personally identify 4 tools that allow FED to make debt cheaper. But before getting into it, I have to explain what kind of debt I am talking about, why particularly that specific kind of bond, and lastly what's the price for it.

First, what kind of debt we are talking about? We are talking about notes. It is not a commercial loan or any sorts like that. We are precisely talking about **the U.S. 10-year treasury note** (often called T-note 10Y or by its ticker ^TNX), which is a type of debt that can be traded and whose issuer is the federal government of the U.S. having a maturity equal to 10 year.
