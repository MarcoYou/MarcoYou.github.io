This is simplified steps before finding Black-Scholes-Merton Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Since I am very lazy, I am skipping important graphical illustration parts and examples. If find any algebraic error, please do let me know at **gunhoqw20@gmail.com**.

## 1. Portfolio Selection

The title seems it has a relation with Pr Markowitz's Portfolio Selection Theory but well... it does not (slightly yes because he founded everything...).

Two steps:

1. Suppose two financial assets (or let's just call them shares) A and B. They are in the same portfolio and being invested on the same arbitrary period generating stochastic(fancy word for random) returns \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_B\\).
