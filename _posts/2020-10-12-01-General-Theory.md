In the General Theory of risk, known as Expected Utility Theory developed by Von Neumann and Morgenstern in 1947 (***Theory of Games and Economic Behavior***), only consequences matter (the process and the framing do not matter). The choices made by the agent may affect consequences that are often monetary consequences.

## 1. Expected Utility Model

### 1.1 Lotteries

Two types of information are necessary to describe a **risky environment** :

- **enumeration of all possible outcomes**
  - Set of all possible outcomes (often monetary consequences) that affect the well-being of the decision maker
  - Such set is assumed to be finite ;
- **characterization of the risky environment**
  - Probability vector of the possible outcomes,
  - \\( p_s \\) = probability of outcome \\( s \\) occurring, with \\( \sum{p_s} = 1\\) ;

A lottery \\(L\\) is a vector of probabilities \\( (p_1, \dots, p_s) \\). A lottery can aslo be written as a real random variable X, in other words, it is a function that maps the states of the world into \\( \R \\).
