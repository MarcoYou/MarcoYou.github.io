In the General Theory of risk, known as Expected Utility Theory developed by Von Neumann and Morgenstern in 1947 (***Theory of Games and Economic Behavior***), only consequences matter (the process and the framing do not matter). The choices made by the agent may affect consequences that are often monetary consequences.

## 1. Expected Utility Model

### 1.1 Lotteries

Two types of information are necessary to describe a risky environment :

- **enumeration of all possible outcomes**
  - \\( C \\) : set of all possible outcomes (often monetary consequences) that affect the well-being of the decision maker
  - \\( C \\) is assumed to be finite.
