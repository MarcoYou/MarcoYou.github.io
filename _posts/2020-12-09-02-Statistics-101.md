This chapter introduces/reminds you basic statistical concepts and definitions that you must know before learning econometrics.

## 1. Moments of Distribution

In statistics, we often need to synthetically and algebraically **describe the shape of a PDF**. In order to do that, we introduce measures that capture different aspects of the shape of a PDF of a random variable.

### 1.1 Moments? 

Before introducing different aspects of the shape of a PDF, you might ask yourself, "why is it called **moments**?". This question bothered me for a long time and it still bothers lots of students and even some professors as well. Don't worry it's not because we are stupid. It's because it comes from another science, **physics**.

In physics, a moment is an expression involving the product of a distance and a physical quantity, and in this way it accounts for how the physical quantity is located or arranged (like **mean**!!). Moments are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point. They deal with physical quantities as measured at some distance from that reference point (like **variance**!!).

Now we know why it's called **moments** of distribution. Now let's move on to the next question: "How many moments are there?".

### 1.2 Different moments of distribution

There are four moments that you have to know if you are studying statistics & econometrics.

Let X be a random variable. We can describe PDF(X) with following four moments:

- **Mean** (1st-order moment): mean, also known as average or expected value, locates the centre of distribution;
- **Variance** (2nd-order moment): variance, also known as spread, measures variability of X on its distribution. Square root of variance is also often used in statistics and is called **standard deviation**;
- **Skewness** (3rd-order moment): skewness measures asymmetry of distribution;
- **Kurtosis** (4th-order moment): kurtosis measures how thick are tails of distribution. In other words, it measures the likelihood of observing realisations that are far away from the mean.

## 2. Intuition Behind Moments Measures

In this section, I will try to explain as intuitive as possible why the above four measures are being used in statistics. Detailed mathematical explanation will be followed in the 3rd section.

### 2.1 Mean and Variance

Consider the following dataset: 

$$ [-3, -1, 1, 2, 2, 5] $$

Let's present them on a line (x-axis):
