This is a note which includes simplified steps before getting to Black-Scholes-Merton Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and CAPM itself as well. Since I am very lazy, I am skipping important graphical illustration parts and examples. If you find any algebraic error, please do let me know at **gunhoqw20@gmail.com**.

## 1. Portfolio Selection

The title seems it has a relation with Pr Markowitz's Portfolio Selection Theory but well... it does not (slightly yes because he basically founded everything).

Two steps:

1. Suppose two financial assets (or let's just call them shares) A and B. They are in the same portfolio and being invested on the same arbitrary period generating stochastic (fancy word for random) returns \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_B\\).

2. Suppose we invest a unit of investment \\(I\\) (=1) which has following allocations: 
  \\(x\\), proportion for A, and \\((1-x)\\), proportion for B. Let's call future values of shares A and B as \\(V_A\\) and \\(V_B\\).

3. Returns of \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_B\\) are determined by:

$$\begin{matrix} R_A = V_A - 1 \\ R_B = V_B -1 \end{matrix}$$

5. Since \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_B\\) are random variables, they both have fisrt-order moment (mean) and second-order moment (variance)
