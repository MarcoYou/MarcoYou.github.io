  Hi, my name is Marco, and I'm a Korean graduate student living in Paris since 2012.
  I had majored in Economics and minored in Monetary Finance during my Bachelor's degree at University Paris II Panthéon-Assas. And I finished the first year of my Master's degree majoring in Econometrics and Statistics and minoring in Statistical Financial Engineering at Paris II as well.
  
  
  From September 2020, I will be studying at Paris School of Economics and Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, in applied economics, in Economic Decision and Cost-Benefit Analysis Course.
    
  Thank you for visiting my CV site. :) <br/>

  Alongside my interests in economics and finance, some of my other interests are:
   - Investment: I have been investing in numerous stocks and ETFs. It taught me to understand different ratios and momentum of stocks.
   - Technology: I visited at IBM-Korea in 2018 and conducted an interview with the Sales Manager Mr.Park, about IBM’s Artificial Intelligence Watson
   - Sport: I lost 30kg 100kg between 2016 and 2017! It was a huge challenge.
